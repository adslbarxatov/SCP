# Introduction

This Policy (SCP), its positions and conclusion describes general rules that we follow in our functioning
and in all our projects. It is ***required to be acquainted and must be respected by all participants of all our communities***.

Note that this Policy is protective and not restrictive. However, failure to become familiar with the Policy
does not deprive the administration of the right to apply it.

&nbsp;



# Clauses of the Policy

### 1. Hurt

:warning: **We’re against of hurting**. No malicious activities allowed in our communities, including:
- direct offends;
- bullying;
- deliberate harm;
- aforethought damage;
- direct threats;
- fakes;
- disinformation;
- destructive criticism (that exists only for criticism and doesn’t contain constructive solutions).

*Participation in them or calls for participation may be grounds for a permanent ban*. Cases of indirect hurting
may be reviewed by the administration separately.

### 2. “Sore issues”

:warning: **We don’t deal with “sore issues”**.
Our communities don’t allow discussions, activities and measures on social, political, economic and other topics,
that most likely will cause counterproductive forms of activity (primarily those described in position 1).

*Forcing such discussions and activities can be grounds for a permanent ban*.

### 3. Advertisements

:warning: **Advertisements** in our communities are only allowed in case described in position 2
of [Applications development policy](https://adslbarxatov.github.io/ADP), that is when a member of the community
presents information about his own development.

*Untargeted (generic) ads elements can be grounds for a permanent ban*.

### 4. Content

:warning: **No payments and / or restrictions for content are permitted**. All texts, pictures, diagrams, datasets
and other information objects should be provided from communities to members and from members to communities
free of any copyrights and without any payments, explicit and implied.

*All rights issues should be resolved by sender before submitting of content. Non-free content must be removed from free access*.

Only an attribution of the author is allowed. If no author information is provided, content’s sender must be listed
as its creator (with all the ensuing consequences).

&nbsp;



# Conclusion

Clauses of the policy derive one from another and guarantee that:
- We will (as much as possible) protect members of our communities from unwanted (unrequested), inappropriate
(that aren’t in community’s aims) and other malicious effects that may be caused by content and activities described by Clauses.
- We will support constructive discussions and critics.
- We will support all thematic content.
